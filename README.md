# MVVM Sample project with Dagger2 &amp; Databinding &amp; Room &amp; RxJava in Kotlin
The project is a great sample of Mvvm architecture.

It reads data from a json file (which contains words and the meanings) in assets folder. The data will be parsed using the klaxon and saved in the room database.
It will then print the first word and its meaning using databinding.

Next step:

show data in a list and let the user search words
